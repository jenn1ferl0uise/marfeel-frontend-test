## Hello and Welcome to the Github Username Search page!

The app will run with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337`
and can be accessed at http://localhost:1337/ for all your Github user searching needs :)

Based on the test specs provided here https://github.com/Marfeel/FrontendTest/

**********

* I have used webpack before (with rails), but have never built it myself from scratch ... so I tried to do so for this test but unfortunately I couldn't manage to get it to work (yet). I left the files as I will keep working on it. I was following the webpack site instuctions (https://webpack.js.org/), but I need more practice.

* If I had managed I would have seperated the Javacript modules and exported { fetchUsers } and { fetchRepos } into the index.js file to be used in the form function.

* I would have also preferred to use scss rather than css files, as I have been doing in Rails... but I have seperated the components into their own concerns at least.

* I took roughly 12 hours to finish the test. Mostly due to trying to learn webpack :).

* I did not get on to learning Jasmine or Karma Unit testing (though I do understand and know the importance, and have used Rspec for Ruby). I started to leanr Jasmine but didn't have enough time to impliment it, sorry!

* Thank you for the opportunity!!
